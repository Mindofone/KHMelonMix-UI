melonDS, sorta

This project aims to turn the Kingdom Hearts DS games into playable PC games with a single screen and controls suited for a regular controller.

This is a version of melonDS with some modifications made specifically to improve those specific games experience. Any issues you have with KH Melon Mix should be reported in this same repository, and not in melonDS repository.

## How to play "Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days"

1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/vitor251093/KHMelonMix/releases/latest) for your system (not the source code zip);
2. Open the downloaded ZIP file and copy the contents to an empty folder;
3. Dump an original copy of "Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days" and copy the NDS file to your computer;
4. Rename that NDS file to "days.nds", place it inside a folder named "roms", and then place that folder next to the Melon Mix executable that you just copied;
5. Replace the assets folder with [this assets folder](https://mega.nz/folder/lpgykK5Y#HPJuOSceHSzncDjQh0DUtw) (this step is only required if you want to replace the DS cutscenes with HD cutscenes);
6. Now you just need to launch the Melon Mix using "MelonMix_KHDays.bat" (or MelonMix_KHDays.sh if you are not on Windows).

## How to play "Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded" (still a WIP; only for testing purposes)

1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/vitor251093/KHMelonMix/releases/latest) for your system (not the source code zip);
2. Open the downloaded ZIP file and copy the contents to an empty folder;
3. Dump an original copy of "Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded" and copy the NDS file to your computer;
4. Rename that NDS file to "recoded.nds", place it inside a folder named "roms", and then place that folder next to the Melon Mix executable that you just copied;
5. Now you just need to launch the Melon Mix using "MelonMix_KHReCoded.bat" (or MelonMix_KHReCoded.sh if you are not on Windows).

### Recommended Controller Binds
* (DS Keypad tab) Map the DS D-Pad to your controller's left analog stick
* (DS Keypad tab) Map the Select/Start buttons to the equivalent keys in your controller
* (DS Keypad tab) Map the A/B/X/Y buttons to the equivalent keys in your controller
* (DS Keypad tab) Map the L button to the L/L1/LB button in your controller
* (Touch Screen tab) Map the DS Touch Screen to your controller's right analog stick
* (Add-ons tab) Map the command menu to your controller's D-Pad
* (Add-ons tab) Map R1 and R2 rather than the R button from the DS keypad tab
* (Add-ons tab) Map the HUD Toggle to an available button of your preference
* (General hotkeys) Map Toggle fullscreen to an available button of your preference

### Steam Deck
The AppImage build is compatible with the Steam Deck. In order to use it, download the AppImage build, extract the zip, right click the AppImage and go to "Properties". Then go to the "Permissions" tab and check the "Allow executing file as program" checkbox. Don't forget the NDS file, like mentioned above.

## How to build from scratch

### Linux
1. Install dependencies:
   * Ubuntu 22.04: `sudo apt install cmake extra-cmake-modules libcurl4-gnutls-dev libpcap0.8-dev libsdl2-dev qtbase5-dev qtbase5-private-dev qtmultimedia5-dev libarchive-dev libzstd-dev qt6-base-dev qt6-base-private-dev qt6-multimedia-dev`
   * Older Ubuntu: `sudo apt install cmake extra-cmake-modules libcurl4-gnutls-dev libpcap0.8-dev libsdl2-dev qt5-default qtbase5-private-dev qtmultimedia5-dev libarchive-dev libzstd-dev qt6-base-dev qt6-base-private-dev qt6-multimedia-dev`
   * Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake extra-cmake-modules git libpcap sdl2 qt5-base qt5-multimedia libarchive zstd qt6-base-dev qt6-base-private-dev qt6-multimedia-dev`
3. Download the KH Melon Mix repository and prepare:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vitor251093/KHMelonMix
   cd KHMelonMix
   ```

3. Compile:
   ```bash
   cmake -B build -DUSE_QT6=ON
   cmake --build build -j$(nproc --all)
   ```

### Windows
1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
2. Open the **MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit** terminal
3. Update the packages using `pacman -Syu` and reopen the terminal if it asks you to
4. Install git to clone the repository
   ```bash
   pacman -S git
   ```
5. Download the KH Melon Mix repository and prepare:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vitor251093/KHMelonMix
   cd KHMelonMix
   ```
#### Dynamic builds (with DLLs)
5. Install dependencies: `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-{cmake,SDL2,toolchain,qt6-static,qt6-base,qt6-multimedia,libarchive,zstd}`
6. Compile:
   ```bash
   cmake -B build -DUSE_QT6=ON
   cmake --build build
   cd build
   ../tools/msys-dist.sh
   ```
If everything went well, KH Melon Mix and the libraries it needs should now be in the `dist` folder.

#### Static builds (without DLLs, standalone executable) (currently failing)
5. Install dependencies: `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-{cmake,SDL2,toolchain,qt6-static,qt6-base,qt6-multimedia,libarchive,zstd}`
6. Compile:
   ```bash
   cmake -B build -DBUILD_STATIC=ON -DUSE_QT6=ON
   cmake --build build
   ```
If everything went well, KH Melon Mix should now be in the `build` folder.

### macOS
1. Install the [Homebrew Package Manager](https://brew.sh)
2. Install dependencies: `brew install git pkg-config cmake sdl2 qt@6 libarchive zstd`
3. Download the KH Melon Mix repository and prepare:
   ```zsh
   git clone https://github.com/vitor251093/KHMelonMix
   cd KHMelonMix
   ```
4. Compile:
   ```zsh
   cmake -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$(brew --prefix qt@6);$(brew --prefix libarchive)" -DUSE_QT6=ON
   cmake --build build -j$(sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu)
   ```
If everything went well, MelonMix.app should now be in the `build` directory.

#### Self-contained app bundle
If you want an app bundle that can be distributed to other computers without needing to install dependencies through Homebrew, you can additionally run `
../tools/mac-bundle.rb MelonMix.app` after the build is completed, or add `-DMACOS_BUNDLE_LIBS=ON` to the first CMake command.
